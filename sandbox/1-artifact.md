Write a melancholic haiku using vivid imagery that instills a sense of wistfulness. Make sure to adhere to the show-don't-tell rule emblematic of this poetic form. Use literary devices like metaphors, similes, alliterations, etc., effectively and aim to evoke sensory experiences in the reader, for a potent emotional impact. As an example, consider this prompt, "A sighing willow, her hair weeps in the autumn, leaves whisper 'farewell'."
