Compose a haiku that embraces a theme of poignant longing and wistfulness. Consider integrating emotive language and sensory descriptions to deeply engage the reader. If helpful, you may wish to imagine writing this from the perspective of a person yearning for their cherished childhood home. However, feel free to let your imagination explore other significant scenarios fitting to the theme as well.
