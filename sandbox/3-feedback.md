The prompt is quite clear and well-structured, with specific instructions and guidelines that the user needs to follow. It accurately specifies the tonality of the haiku (melancholy) and the importance of vivid imagery, show-don't-tell rule, and literary devices. Moreover, further emphasizing the need to invoke sensory experiences helps guide the writer towards creating a deeply impacting haiku. 

A possible suggestion could be to provide examples for the 'literary devices' mentioned, to aid someone less familiar with them in incorporating such elements effectively. Other than that, this is an efficiently composed and articulated prompt.
